# Avoid the Knifes

**Avoid the Knifes** is an open-source project written in Rust using the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine. This project is a playground to help me learn more about Rust and Bevy while creating a fun and interactive game. The primary objective of the game is to avoid falling knives while collecting coins to increase your score. 

As I continue to learn, I will be gradually adding new features to enhance the game. The next planned features include animations and a main menu.

## Features

- **Basic Gameplay**: Move the player to avoid falling knives and collect coins.
- **Score System**: Earn points for every coin collected.
- **Future Plans**: 
  - Animations for smoother and more engaging gameplay.
